            <p>I am a HongKonger. I lived there for 36 years. Hong Kong was full of opportunities and had the most culturally
                 diversified lifestyle in the world. I had never though that I might leave HK and live in another country. </p>

            <h2 class="article-title">Comfort-zone</h2>
            <p>I was an editor for many years in Hong Kong, I loved that job because it gave me a very stable life. When I 
                was free, I spent the time hanging around with my friends. I did not think that there was a need to change. 
                Like many HongKongers, I saved money to buy a flat. I enjoyed working like an ant to pay mortgage. I thought 
                of buying another apartment for letting, which was a typical dream of HongKonger.</p>

            <img src="./image/unrest.jpg" alt="Unrest in Hong Kong in 2019" />
            <h2 class="article-title">Unrest</h2>
            <p>Because Hong Kong government wanted to pass a law that most HongKong people worried, millions came 
                to the street. As the government refused to back down, the protest later developed into city warfares. The 
                protest continued until China grabed the Covid as a chance to abolish most freedoms of HongKongers. I felt 
                that I had to leave Hong Kong as I saw no hopes in my beloved home city.</p>

            <h2 class="article-title">Settle</h2>
            <p>I came here in last July. It was difficult to find a job and I worked in a warehouse and now I am a bank
                worker in NHS. Fortunately, there is no racial discrimination which I had feared. I am now taking a bootcamp and 
                hoped to become a programmer in the future. </p>
