            <p>I am a HongKonger. I lived there for 36 years. Hong Kong was full of opportunities and had the most culturally
                 diversified lifestyle in the world. I had never though that I might leave HK and live in another country. </p>

            <img src="./image/With-friends.jpg" alt="Meeting with friends" />
            <h2 class="article-title">Comfort-zone</h2>
            <p>I was an editor for many years in Hong Kong, I loved that job because it gave me a very stable life. When I 
                was free, I spent the time hanging around with my friends. I did not think that there was a need to change. 
                Like many HongKongers, I saved money to buy a flat. I enjoyed working like an ant to pay mortgage. I thought 
                of buying another apartment for letting, which was a typical dream of HongKonger.</p>
