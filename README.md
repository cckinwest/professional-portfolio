## Purpose
This assignment is to create a portfolio for showing my skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position.

## Structure of the webpage
This webpage contains a header, a section called "Story", a section called "Work" and a section called "Contact".

### header
It contains my profile pic contained in a circle, a title, and a menu in which links are created to direct to different sections.

### Story
It contains the introduction of my background and the reason why I left Hong Kong and came to the UK. There is a pagination menu for navigation to different pages.

### Work
It contains links which direct to the projects that I did previously. On each block, there are background picture, a tag showing the name of the project and skills involved. The block of the first project occupies whole width and the rest occupy half-width.

### Contact
It contains two links: Email and Github. Clicking Email can send email to me. Clicking Github can direct to my github page.

## Responsive design
This page has several breakpoints: 1200px, 1024px, and 768px. Different widths are handled differently as shown below.

### 1200px
The title name at the header "ChiKin's Profile" goes to the bottom of my profile-pic. The title and the pic are diminished by a little bit.
